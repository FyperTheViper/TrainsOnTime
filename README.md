For this project we created a firebase project to store our info so many different machines could access it at once. Users can set the schedules of trains using four parameters. 

Three of those parameters (Name, Destination, and Frequency) are directly appeneded to a table while the fourth parameter is used to calculate next arrival and minutes away, with the help of Moment.js.
